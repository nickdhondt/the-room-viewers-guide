                    <p>Attending a Room-screening, or hosting one with your friends, is supposed to be fun. Cheering is part of the game. You can cheer, applaud, whistle or yell things during certain moments in the film.</p>
                    <h3>Wiseau!</h3>
                    <p>The most obvious ones are in the opening credits. You cheer when you read ‘Tommy Wiseau’ (which is about 10 times in the opening credits, since the guy did pretty much everything), and you go full rampage when ‘THE ROOM’-title appears in all its glory. It is only appropriate that we thank <mark>(typo)</mark> the film’s director for the existence of this masterpiece.</p>
                    <h3>Flower shop</h3>
                    <p>When the flower shop-scene starts, which perfectly captures the entire spirit of the film, cheer at the start, applaud in the end.</p>
                    <h3><em>Spoon!</em></h3>
                    <p>If you ever find yourself thinking: ‘100 spoons should be enough for one film,’ don’t kid yourself. Bring as much plastic spoons as you can. Every time you spot the spoon-featured artwork in the background, hurl as much spoons at the screen as you can. The closer you are to the screen, the more extra spoons you will receive from the people in the back.</p>
                    <p>The old Viewer’s Guide mentioned that you can just throw spoons out of boredom. This is not generally appreciated. Keep your spoons for when it counts. If, for some reason, you find yourself with an overabundance of spoons after the film is finished, use them during the end credits to accompany the audience’s cheering.</p>
                    <h3><em>Oh hai Doggy!</em></h3>
                    <p>This is by far one of the most iconic and quoted lines in the movie. Everyone will yell it off the top of their lungs, so go along with it. Look for it in the flower shop-scene. You will notice it when everyone starts cheering for no reason.</p>
                    <h3><em>You are tearing me apart, Lisa!</em></h3>
                    <p>‘Oh hai Doggy’ is the most iconic line for the fans, but ‘You are tearing me apart, Lisa’ is the most famous line in its own right. If you don’t know where it is: if the entire audience starts to get uneasy, arms by their side like they're <mark>(typo)</mark> waiting for a football team to score a point, you know it’s coming. After the line-delivery, it is appropriate to cheer.</p>
                    <h3><em>Oh hai character!!</em></h3>
                    <p>For some reason, the film always shows characters leaving and entering a scene. Every.single.time. While this is something that can get you expelled from film school, it is also a great thing to make fun of. Every time a character enters, give him/her a proper greeting.</p>
                    <h3><em>Goodbye character!</em></h3>
                    <p>Likewise, when a character leaves the frame, say goodbye to him. If you want to check up on the knowledge of your fellow roomies, try saying goodbye to each of the characters when they go outside during the party scene.</p>
                    <h3><em>Focus! Unfocus!!</em></h3>
                    <p>The cinematography is consistent with the film’s plot, which means it’s crap. Every time a shot’s blurry, shout “FOCUS!” However, some of the ‘erotic’ scenes (yeah, I just used the word ‘erotic’ to describe the sex scenes) could use a bit less focus. Yell “UNFOCUS!”</p>
                    <h3><em>Because<mark>(c vergeten in document)</mark> you’re a woman!</em></h3>
                    <p>You owe it to your female friends to subvert the film’s<mark>(" ipv ' in document)</mark> misogyny into something funny. Every time a woman is portrayed as a heartless, manipulative, good-for-nothing- non-autonomous bitch, shout ‘Because you’re a woman!’</p>
                    <h3><em>Meanwhile in San Francisco!</em></h3>
                    <p>There a LOT of establishing shots in this film. When you see one, remind the audience that this is San Francisco. However, don’t overdo it. Nearer to the ending, the establishing shots become so overabundant that constantly saying the line becomes a drag.</p>
                    <h3><em>Go! Go! Go! Go!</em></h3>
                    <p>There are a couple of tracking shots featuring the San Francisco Bridge. (this is obviously a metaphor for the connection and break-up between human beings, right?) You can cheer the camera on while panning. Celebrate/cheer when the camera makes it to the end, express your disappointment when it doesn’t.</p>
                    <h3><em>It’s a metaphor!</em></h3>
                    <p>Some of the shots in the film are explicitly metaphorical. Denny eating an apple at the start of the film might be interpreted as giving into temptation. (I don’t know either, I’m just making stuff up) When this happens, shout “It’s a metaphor.” You know, to make sure there aren’t any misunderstandings. This can also be used when the rain drips over the windows during some of the more explicit scenes. Or when Johnny destroys the mirror.</p>
                    <h3><em>Cheep cheep cheep</em></h3>
                    <p>When Wiseau imitates a chicken (this happens about three times in the film), produce the CHEEP CHEEP CHEEP-sound as loud as you can, while performing your best chicken-imitation.</p>
                    <h3><em>Who the fuck are you?</em></h3>
                    <p>A lot of characters just appear for no reason. You don’t know who they are or where they come from. You also shouldn’t care. Whenever this happens, shout “who the fuck are you?” When Peter is replaced by another actor, who doesn’t resemble Peter AT ALL, you can also deliver this line. From my experience, most of the audience doesn’t even realize that it’s the same Peter.</p>
                    <h3><em>HAHAHAHA</em></h3>
                    <p>Johnny has a weird way of laughing. It is the perfect ringtone, and a screening is the perfect occasion to make fun of it.</p>
                    <h3><em>Wow wow wow</em></h3>
                    <p>When Mark tries to throw Peter off the roof, start yelling in panic due to the intensity of this scene. When it’s over, you can say things like “wow, that was intense.”</p>
                    <h3><em>Are you okay?</em></h3>
                    <p>When Peter trips while playing football, express your concerns for that nasty fall.</p>
                    <h3><em>No no NOOOOOOOOO</em></h3>
                    <p><mark>(Vinnie, kan je hier bij plaatsen waar in de film dit ongeveer gebeurt? Dit is de eerste sex scene, right?)</mark>Upon witnessing Tommy Wiseau’s ass, and in the seconds preceding it, yell as scared and grossed out as you can.</p>

                    <h3>Playing football</h3>
                    <p>A lot of scenes feature characters playing football. When this happens, just do the same with your friends. Position yourself strategically in the theatre, or just stand up and throw from the sides. Just make sure not to hit the screen. Or, to a lesser extent, other people.</p>
                    <h3>Reenactment</h3>
                    <p>If you want to take your Room-love to a new level, you can dress up and act out different scenes next to the screen for audiences to enjoy. The most popular one is “Denny VS Chris R.” But feel free to experiment.</p>
                    <h3>Pillow fight!</h3>
                    <p>You can bring a small pillow to smack your friends at the appropriate moments in the film. Also, if you’ve managed to bring a friend that doesn’t like the film, you can use it to punch him when he falls asleep.</p>
                    <h3>Break time</h3>
                    <p>A Room-screening is fun, but also exhausting. If you’re in need for a break, use the last sex scene featuring Mark and Lisa. <mark>(This)</mark> Is the longest and most uneventful. So if you want to empty your bladder before the film’s last part, or take a quick puff of a cigarette, now’s the time. When attending larger screenings, expect long waiting lines at the toilet.</p>
                    <h3>Mission Impossible</h3>
                    <p>When Johnny starts taping the phone, start humming the Mission Impossible-theme. This sometimes poses issues, as it is unclear where to start humming. It starts when he hooks the recorder up, not when he pulls it out of his pocket. (because, you know, that’s where you keep tape recorders.)</p>
                    <h3>Sit on the floor</h3>
                    <p>When Denny suddenly sits on the floor, you can do the same, for as long as you like. Just make sure not to miss anything important.</p>
                    <h3>Mourning</h3>
                    <p>Spoiler alert: <span class="spoiler">Johnny dies in the end</span>. When he’s lying on the floor with the other characters, get up from your seat and stand next to the screen, to stand alongside the characters. Express your heartfelt sorrow for <span class="spoiler">Johnny’s death</span>. I’ve seen people cheering after <span class="spoiler">the gun shot</span>, don’t do this. The scene requires something different.</p>

                    <p>There are two songs that are great to sing along to. They accompany the film’s first two sex scenes. Learn the lyrics, bring a lighter, and go full Titanic-mode when it starts. If you can’t use a lighter, use a cell phone.</p>
                    <p>Remember to keep delivering comments during the scenes itself. Especially when Johnny tries to penetrate Lisa’s belly button.</p>
